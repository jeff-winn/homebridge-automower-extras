title: Removing a mower
sub_title: Are you trying to remove an existing mower?
introduction: |
    When problems arise there are occasions when the cached mower in use by your Homebridge will need to be removed. This should generally be considered a "last resort" when trying to fix problems, as it is intrusive to your HomeKit setup.

To remove a mower, please follow the instructions provided here.

**CAUTION:** Removing an accessory **WILL** cause any scenes and automations to be updated and you **WILL** need to re-create any scenes and automations that used the mower.

- Open the Homebridge UI.
- Open the Homebridge Settings menu.
- In the Manage Cached Accessories section, click the button to Remove Single Cached Accessory.
- Within the modal window that appears, find the mower you wish to remove and click the trash icon (the accessory may take a few seconds to remove).
- Click Close.
- Restart Homebridge.

The accessory should now be removed from Homebridge. If the mower is still registered with your Husqvarna account, it will re-appear automatically after the Homebridge restart completes.
