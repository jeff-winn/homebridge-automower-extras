error_message: |
    \[CFG0001\] - The appKey setting is missing, please check your configuration and try again.

### Cause:
This is likely due to an improper configuration of the plugin. 

### Details:
Typically when the plugin installs, it includes a default application key (aka the appKey) that is used for communications with the Husqvarna Cloud APIs. If this value is incorrect or missing, the Husqvarna APIs will not let the plugin access their services.

### How to Fix:
From the user interface:
- Edit the platform plugin instance that is causing issues.
- Expand the Advanced Settings group.
- Set the application key to the following value:
