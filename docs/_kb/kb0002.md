### Cause:
This is likely due to an improper configuration of the plugin. 

### Details:
When you are adding an instance of the platform to your Homebridge server, your Husqvarna credentials are required to allow the plugin to access and control any mowers registered to your Husqvarna account.

### How to Fix:
From the user interface:
- Edit the platform plugin instance that is causing issues.
- Correct the Email Address and/or Password fields.
- Restart your server.
